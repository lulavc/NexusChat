# Error Attempts Log

## 2025-02-10 03:30

### 1. Direct Chat Manager Access
**Attempt**: Tried to access chat manager directly from GUI components
**Result**: Caused tight coupling and initialization errors
**Impact**: Application failed to start due to missing dependencies
```python
self.chat_manager = ChatManager()  # Wrong: Missing required dependencies
```

### 2. Synchronous Model Loading
**Attempt**: Tried to load models synchronously
**Result**: UI froze during model loading
**Impact**: Poor user experience and potential deadlocks
```python
def load_models(self):  # Wrong: Should be async
    models = self.client.list_models()
```

### 3. Missing Error Handlers
**Attempt**: Added error handling without proper context
**Result**: Errors were caught but not properly handled
**Impact**: Application silently failed without user feedback
```python
try:
    # operation
except Exception:
    pass  # Wrong: Silent failure
```

### 4. Incorrect Theme Implementation
**Attempt**: Tried to set colors directly in widgets
**Result**: Inconsistent styling and missing constants
**Impact**: GUI failed to initialize properly
```python
self.button.configure(fg_color="#123456")  # Wrong: Hard-coded colors
```

### 5. Incorrect Event Loop
**Attempt**: Mixed async and sync code without proper event loop
**Result**: Coroutines were never awaited
**Impact**: Async operations failed silently
```python
async def load():  # Wrong: No event loop configuration
    await operation()
```

### 6. Async App Initialization
**Attempt**: Tried to initialize async components in sync context
**Result**: Event loop not available during initialization
**Impact**: Model selector and chat components failed to initialize
```python
class App(ctk.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Wrong: Async operations in sync context
        self.model_selector = ModelSelector()  
        self.chat_window = ChatWindow()
```

### 7. Event Loop Management
**Attempt**: Created event loop but not properly integrated with tkinter
**Result**: GUI updates blocked by event loop
**Impact**: Application became unresponsive
```python
def run(self):
    # Wrong: Blocks GUI updates
    self.loop.run_forever()  
```

### 8. Async Initialization Error
**Attempt**: Tried to initialize async components without awaiting
**Result**: Async operations were not properly initialized
**Impact**: Application failed to start due to missing async initialization
```python
async def init_async_components(self):
    # Wrong: Missing await for async initialization
    self.async_component = AsyncComponent()
