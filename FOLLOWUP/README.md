# FOLLOWUP Directory

This directory contains logs tracking the development progress of the Ollama Chat application:

## Files:

1. **CORRECT-LOG.md**
   - Contains successful fixes and improvements
   - Documents problems and their solutions
   - Tracks architectural improvements

2. **ERROR-LOG.md**
   - Records unsuccessful attempts
   - Documents code that made things worse
   - Helps avoid repeating mistakes

## How to Use:

- Check CORRECT-LOG.md before implementing new features to avoid regression
- Review ERROR-LOG.md before trying new approaches to avoid known pitfalls
- Keep both logs updated with timestamps and clear descriptions
